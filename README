Chafa
=====

Chafa is a command-line utility that converts image data, including
animated GIFs, into graphics formats or ANSI/Unicode character art suitable
for display in a terminal. It has broad feature support, allowing it to be
used on devices ranging from historical teleprinters to modern terminal
emulators and everything in between.

The core functionality is provided by a C library with a public,
well-documented API.

Both library and frontend tools are covered by the Lesser GPL license,
version 3 or later (LGPLv3+).

Installing from tarball
-----------------------

You will need GCC, make and the GLib development package installed to
compile Chafa from a release tarball. If you want to build the
command-line tool `chafa` and not just the library, you will
additionally need the ImageMagick development packages.

Prebuilt documentation is included in the release tarball, and you do not
need gtk-doc unless you want to make changes/rebuild it.

After unpacking, cd to the toplevel directory and issue the following
shell commands:

$ ./configure
$ make
$ sudo make install

Installing from git repository
------------------------------

You will need GCC, make, Autoconf, Automake, Libtool and the GLib
development package installed to compile Chafa from its git repository. If
you want to build the command-line tool `chafa` and not just the library,
you will additionally need development packages for:

* FreeType2
* ImageMagick
* libjpeg (optional)
* libwebp (optional)

If you want to build documentation, you will also need gtk-doc.

Start by cloning the repository:

$ git clone https://github.com/hpjansson/chafa.git

Then cd to the toplevel directory and issue the following shell commands:

$ ./autogen.sh
$ make
$ sudo make install
