Chafa
=====

Chafa is a command-line utility that converts all kinds of images, including
animated GIFs, into sixel or ANSI/Unicode character output that can be
displayed in a terminal.

It is highly configurable, with support for alpha transparency and multiple
color modes and color spaces, combining selectable ranges of Unicode
characters to produce the desired output.

The core functionality is provided by a C library with a public,
well-documented API.

Both library and frontend tools are covered by the Lesser GPL license,
version 3 or later (LGPLv3+).

Installing from tarball
-----------------------

You will need GCC, make and the GLib development package installed to
compile Chafa from a release tarball. If you want to build the
command-line tool `chafa` and not just the library, you will
additionally need the ImageMagick development packages.

Prebuilt documentation is included in the release tarball, and you do not
need gtk-doc unless you want to make changes/rebuild it.

After unpacking, cd to the toplevel directory and issue the following
shell commands:

$ ./configure
$ make
$ sudo make install

Installing from git repository
------------------------------

You will need GCC, make, Autoconf, Automake, Libtool and the GLib
development package installed to compile Chafa from its git repository. If
you want to build the command-line tool `chafa` and not just the library,
you will additionally need the ImageMagick development packages.

If you want to build documentation, you will also need gtk-doc.

Start by cloning the repository:

$ git clone https://github.com/hpjansson/chafa.git

Then cd to the toplevel directory and issue the following shell commands:

$ ./autogen.sh
$ make
$ sudo make install
